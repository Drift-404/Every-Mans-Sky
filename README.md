> Most assets are loaded using local absolute paths, please change it to relative paths while working.
> After cloning the repo, initalize a venv and run everything within it.
> Don't push to main unless verified.
> Try to create seperate files and modules as much as possible for better compatibility/debugging/efficiency (leave main alone as much as possible).
